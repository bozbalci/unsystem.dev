Hi, welcome to my personal blog! I've spent the last 8-10 hours building it using
[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/). I have to say that the experience has been real
smooth, and I do plan on writing about it. There's not much here for now, but be
sure to check later!

## The public TODO list

Here's what I have to work on. I'm putting this on my public blog to give myself incentive to
work on these issues sooner:

- Put more content here
  - Seriously, get back to it
- Styling fixes
  - Headings
  - Lists
  - Refactor the file structure, fix importing issues
  - Pick a better background color than `aliceblue`
  - Typography: it's all over the place!!
- (?) Remove the `noscript` warning that Gatsby gives by default
- Refactor the "about me" page to load its contents from Markdown
